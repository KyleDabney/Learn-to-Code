        <li>Practice implementing CSS into your ugly HTML pages that you just created</li>
        <li>I recommend either JavaScript or Python for your first choice of language.  Python will be easier to understand if you've never been involved with programming</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp">w3schools.com</a> Read through the material here for JavaScript language only! Understand it before trying to implement this into an HTML/CSS project you've been working on</li>

        <li>The last step is to build a simple website, then build it again and again until you don't need to look up how to do it.  Then build a more complex website and continue the same pattern as above. You'll always need to look something up as you get further into the craft.  Once you fully understand what you're doing, then create your final website (Portfolio) which includes your more impressive works.  finally, start working on interview questions and applying for jobs (100's of them) The more you apply, the more you'll understand.</li>
